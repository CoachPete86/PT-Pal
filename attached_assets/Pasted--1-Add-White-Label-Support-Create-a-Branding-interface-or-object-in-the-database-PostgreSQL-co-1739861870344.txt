	1.	Add White Label Support
	•	Create a Branding interface or object in the database (PostgreSQL) containing custom theme colours, a logo URL, and additional brand assets.
	•	Extend the user or organisation schema to include a reference to the new Branding object (e.g., organisation.branding_id).
	•	In the React frontend, adjust Tailwind CSS classes to read from the branding object if it exists (background, text colour, accent colour).
	•	Modify the layout components (Navbar, Sidebar, Footer) to display the relevant logo and theme.
	•	Provide an admin interface under “Organisation Settings” where users can upload logos, change colour themes, and preview changes in real time.
	2.	Monetisation & Subscription Tiers
	•	Introduce a new column/property in your user/organisation table (e.g., subscriptionTier: “FREE”, “BASIC”, “PRO”).
	•	Conditionally render certain routes or components (AI analytics, advanced scheduling, etc.) based on subscription level.
	•	Provide a subscription flow using Stripe (or similar) for upgrading tiers.
	3.	Site Structure & Layout
	•	Implement a global <Layout> component in React containing a sidebar (or navbar) with dynamic branding, a main content area, and an optional footer.
	•	Organise navigation links by major feature categories (Dashboard, Clients, Scheduling, Analytics, Settings).
	•	Ensure mobile responsiveness using Tailwind’s responsive classes (md:, lg:). Collapse sidebars into a hamburger menu for smaller screens.
	4.	Enhanced Analytics & Reporting
	•	In an <AnalyticsDashboard>, implement multiple tabs: “Sessions”, “Clients”, “Revenue”, “Retention”.
	•	Use a charting library (e.g., Recharts, Chart.js) with styling derived from the active branding.
	•	Fetch data via React Query, factoring in the user’s subscription tier and branding preferences.
	5.	AI-Powered Content & Workouts
	•	Extend the existing AI microservice calls (Anthropic AI) in a dedicated utility file (e.g., aiService.ts).
	•	Add a “Generate Plan” button in the workout planning section, with real-time loading states using React Query.
	•	Style generated results with the organisation’s selected brand colours and fonts.
	6.	Security & Data Protection
	•	Store sensitive data (billing details, personal info) in encrypted columns.
	•	Implement 2FA for admin or organisation owners, especially those managing branding or billing.
	•	Use Replit’s “Secrets” feature for environment variables to keep API keys private.
	7.	Testing & Deployment
	•	Write or extend unit tests for new <BrandingSettings> or <Layout> components using Jest + React Testing Library.
	•	Set up continuous integration on Replit (or GitHub Actions) to run tests on every push/pull request.
	•	Capture screenshots or logs to confirm correct branding across different subscription tiers and organisations.
